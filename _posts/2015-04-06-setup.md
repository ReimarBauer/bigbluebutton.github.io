Welcome to the BigBlueButton Developer's Guide.  This document will help you get started quickly with modifying and extending BigBlueButton.

This guide assumes you have a working BigBlueButton server (see [Install BigBlueButton](/install/install.html)).

# Overview

A BigBlueButton server is built from a number of components that corresponds to Ubuntu packages.  Some of these components are

  * bbb-web -- Implements the BigBlueButton API and conversion of documents for presentation
  * bbb-client -- Flash based client that loads within the browser
  * bbb-apps -- Server side applications for supporting client modules
  * bbb-deskshare -- Desktop sharing server

You don't need to understand everything about each component, but you do need to understand the [overall architecture](/overview/architecture.html) and how the components work together.

This document describes how to setup a development environment using an existing BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server.  Once the environment is setup, you will be able to make custom changes to BigBlueButton source, compile the source, and replace the corresponding components on the server (such as updating the BigBlueButton client).

The instructions in this guide are step-by-step so you can understand each step needed to modify a component.  If you encounter problems or errors at any step, don't ignore the errors.  Stop and double-check that you have done the step correctly.  If you are unable to determine the cause of the error, do the following

  * First, use Google to search for the error.  There is a wealth of information in [bigbluebutton-dev] (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev) that Google indexes.
  * Try doing the same steps on a different BigBlueButton server.
  * Post a question to bigbluebutton-dev with a description of the problem and the steps to reproduce. Post logs, error messages to [Pastebin] (http://pastebin.com) and include a link in your email.


## Before you begin

This section makes sure you are ready to set up a BigBlueButton development environment.

### You have a Working BigBlueButton Server

Before you can start developing on BigBlueButton, you have to [install BigBlueButton 0.9.0](/install/install.html) and ensure it's working correctly (i.e. you had no errors during install).

We emphasize that your BigBlueButton server must be working **before** you start setting up the development environment.  Be sure that you can log in, start sessions, join the audio bridge, share your webcam, and record and playback sessions -- all using the built-in API demos.

By starting with a working BigBlueButton server, you have the ability to switch back-and-forth between the default packaged components and any modifications you make.

For example, suppose you modify the BigBlueButton client and something isn't working (such as the client is not fully loading), you can easily switch back to the default packaged client and check that it's working correctly (and thus ruling out any environment issues that may also be preventing your modified client from loading).

**Another Note:** These instructions assume you have the `bbb-demo` package installed so you can run any of the API demos to test your setup.

### Developing on Windows

To develop BigBlueButton from within Windows, use VMWare Player or VirtualBox to first create a Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit virtual machine.  The associated documentation for VMWare Player and VirtualBox will guide you on setting up a new 14.04 64-bit VM.

When setting up the VM, it does not matter to BigBlueButton if you setup Ubuntu 14.04 server or desktop.  If you install desktop, you'll have the option of using a graphical interface to edit files.

Keep in mind, you'll need a host capable of running a [64-bit virtual machine](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56124/can-i-run-a-64-bit-vmware-image-on-a-32-bit-machine).

### Root Privileges

**Important:** Make sure you create another user such as "firstuser", otherwise you'll run into permission errors such as Nginx 403 Forbidden error or [error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3863066/error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson).

Do not run commands as the root user. Only run the commands using sudo.

These instructions are written for an account called "firstuser", but they will apply to any account that has the permissions to execute commands as root, such as

```
sudo ls
```

### wget

You'll need to download some files throughout these instructions using wget. If it's not installed on your server, you can install the package using the following command

```
sudo apt-get install wget
```

### Have a GitHub Account

The BigBlueButton [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).  You need a GitHub account.  Also, you need to be very familiar with how git works.  Specifically, you need to know how to

  * clone a repository
  * create a branch
  * push changes back to a repository

If you have not used git before, or if the terms **_clone_**, **_branch_**, and **_commit_** are unfamiliar to you, stop now.  These are fundamental concepts to git that you need to become competent with before trying to develop on BigBlueButton. To become competent, a good place to start is this [free book](http://progit.org/book/) and [GitHub Help pages] (http://help.github.com/).

Using GitHub makes it easy for you to work on your own copy of the BigBlueButton source, store your updates to the source to your GitHub account, and make it easy for you to [contribute to BigBlueButton](/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

### Subscribe to bigbluebutton-dev

We recommend you subscribe to the [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2) mailing list to follow updates to the development of BigBlueButton and to collaborate with other developers.


# Setup a Development Environment

First you need to install the core development tools.

```
sudo apt-get install git-core ant openjdk-7-jdk	
```

With the the JDK installed, you need to set the JAVA_HOME variable. Edit `~/.profile` (here we are using vim to edit the file)

```
vi ~/.profile
```

Add the following line at the end of the file

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
```

Reload your profile (this will happen automatically when you next login, but we'll do it explicitly here to load the new environment variable).

```
source ~/.profile
```

Do a quick test to ensure JAVA_HOME is set.

```
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
```

Next you need to make a directory to hold the tools needed for BigBlueButton development.

```
mkdir -p ~/dev/tools
cd ~/dev/tools
```

You need to download a number of tools with wget and then unpack each of these tools in the above directory.

```
wget http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.10-bin.zip
unzip gradle-1.10-bin.zip
ln -s gradle-1.10 gradle

wget http://dist.springframework.org.s3.amazonaws.com/release/GRAILS/grails-2.3.6.zip
unzip grails-2.3.6.zip
ln -s grails-2.3.6 grails
```

Next you need to get the Apache Flex 4.13.0 SDK package. 

**Note:** Even though we're downloading the Apache Flex 4.13.0 SDK, BigBlueButton is developed and built with Flex 3 compatibility mode enabled.

First, you need to download the SDK tarball from an Apache mirror site and then unpack it.

```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/flex/4.13.0/binaries/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
tar xvfz apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
```

The Flex SDK is now unpacked.  Next you need to download the Adobe Flex SDK.  We'll do this step manually in case the download fails (if it does, remove the incomplete file and issue the `wget` command again).

```
cd apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/
mkdir -p in/
wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flex/sdk/builds/flex4.6/flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B.zip -P in/
```

Once the SDK has downloaded we can use its `build.xml` script to automatically download the remaining third-party tools.

```
ant -f frameworks/build.xml thirdparty-downloads
```

After Flex downloads the remaining third-party tools, you need to modify their permissions.

```
sudo find ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin -type d -exec chmod o+rx '{}' \;
chmod 755 ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/bin/*
sudo chmod -R +r ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
```

Next, create a linked directory with a shortened name for easier referencing.

```
ln -s ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin ~/dev/tools/flex
```

The next step in setting up the Flex SDK environment is to download a Flex library for video.

```
cd ~/dev/tools/
mkdir -p apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
cd apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
wget http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/installers/archive/playerglobal/playerglobal11_2.swc
mv -f playerglobal11_2.swc playerglobal.swc
```

The last step to have a working Flex SDK is to configure it to work with playerglobal 11.2

```
cd ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
sudo sed -i "s/11.1/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
sudo sed -i "s/<swf-version>14<\/swf-version>/<swf-version>15<\/swf-version>/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
sudo sed -i "s/{playerglobalHome}\/{targetPlayerMajorVersion}.{targetPlayerMinorVersion}/libs\/player\/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
```

With the tools installed, you need to add a set of environment variables to your `.profile` to access these tools.

```
vi ~/.profile
```

Copy-and-paste the following text at bottom of `.profile`.

```

export GRAILS_HOME=$HOME/dev/tools/grails
export PATH=$PATH:$GRAILS_HOME/bin

export FLEX_HOME=$HOME/dev/tools/flex
export PATH=$PATH:$FLEX_HOME/bin

export GRADLE_HOME=$HOME/dev/tools/gradle
export PATH=$PATH:$GRADLE_HOME/bin

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=768m"

```

Reload your profile to use these tools (this will happen automatically when you next login).

```
source ~/.profile
```

Check that the tools are now in your path by running the following command.

```
$ mxmlc -version
Version 4.13.0 build 20140701
```


## Checking out the Source

With the development tools installed, we'll next clone the source in the following directory:

```
/home/firstuser/dev
```

Using your GitHub account, do the following

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the BigBlueButton repository into your GitHub account
2. Clone your repository into your `~/dev` folder

After cloning, you'll have the following directory (make sure the `bigbluebutton` directory is within your `dev` directory).

```
/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
```

Confirm that you are working on the master branch.

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
git status
```

You should see

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

When you first clone the BigBlueButton git repository, git will place you, by default, on the `master` branch, which is the latest code for BigBlueButton.

We need to checkout the `v0.9.0-release` [branch](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/v0.9.0-release).

```
git fetch origin

git checkout v0.9.0-release
```

Confirm that you are in the correct branch.

```
git status

# On branch v0.9.0-release
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```


# Production Environment

Okay. Let's pause for a minute. 

You have set-up the necessary tools and cloned the source. Understand the diagram below on where the different components are in a production set-up. When developing we want to change our configuration settings to load our new changes instead of the ones deployed for production.

![production](/images/prod-env.png)

As you can see, nginx is configured to load the client from `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client` directory and forward calls to web-api on tomcat7. During development, we need to tell nginx to load from our development directory (`/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton`)

After going through the steps below, you will end up with the following setup.

![development](/images/dev-env.png)

The components that run in Red5 don't change as we actually deploy the development files for bbb-apps, bbb-voice, bbb-video, and bbb-deskshare into `/usr/share/red5`. However, notice that the client and web-api are served from a different place.


# Client Development
With the development environment checked out and the code cloned we are ready to start developing!

This section will walk you through making a simple change to the BigBlueButton client.

## Setting up the environment

The first thing you need to do is to copy the template `config.xml` file to the build directory for the client.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/
cp bigbluebutton-client/resources/config.xml.template bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
```

The `config.xml` file is one of the first files loaded by the BigBlueButton client when it connects to the server.  The `config.xml` file tells BigBlueButton client how to load the remaining components (such as chat module, deskshare module, videodock module, etc.) and sets a number of configuration paraemeters for each component.  The `config.xml` specifies the hostname (or IP address) for loading each component.

Let's look at the first ten lines of the `config.xml` file you just copied.

```
$ head -n 10 bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<config>
    <localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
    <version>VERSION</version>
    <help url="http://HOST/help.html"/>
    <javaTest url="http://HOST/testjava.html"/>
    <porttest host="HOST" application="video/portTest" timeout="10000"/>    
    <bwMon server="HOST" application="video/bwTest"/>
    <application uri="rtmp://HOST/bigbluebutton" host="http://HOST/bigbluebutton/api/enter"/>
    <language userSelectionEnabled="true" />
```

You will see the word `HOST` where there would be configured hostname/IP address.  You need to change the text `HOST` to the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.  For example, if your the IP address of the BigBlueButton server is `192.168.1.145`, then using the follwoing command you can easily substitute all occurrences of `HOST` with `192.168.1.145`.

Note: Don't copy-and-paste the following command as-is: the address `192.168.1.145` is likely not the correct IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.  Substitute the IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.

```
sed -i s/HOST/192.168.1.145/g bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
```

After you've done the above command, take a quick look at the file and ensure all instances of `HOST` are properly replaced with the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.

The `config.xml` is ultimately loaded by the BigBlueButton client when a user joins a session on the server.  

Later on, when you deploy your modified client to the BigBlueButton server, there will be two BigBlueButton clients on your server: your modified BigBlueButton client and the default BigBlueButton packaged client (again, this is good as you can switch back and forth). However, the BigBlueButton configuration command `sudo bbb-conf ` only modifies the packaged BigBlueButton client. If you need to manually change your config.xml (such as when the IP address of your server changes) of your modified `config.xml` if you copy the file to a different server.

Next, you need to setup nginx to redirect calls to the client towards your development version. If you don't already have nginx client development file at `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev`, create one with the following command.

**NOTE:** Make sure to replace "firstuser" with your own username if it's different.

```
echo "
location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
	root /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
	expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
	root /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev 
```

Check the contents to ensure it matches below.

Again, make sure you change `/home/firstuser` to match your home directory.

```
$ cat /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev

location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
	root /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
	expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
	root /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
}
```

These rules tell nginx were to find the BigBlueButton client.  Currently, nginx is using the rules with the default BigBlueButton client through a symbolic link.

```
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 2013-05-05 15:44 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client
```

Modify this symbolic link so it points to the development directory for your BigBlueButton client.

```
sudo ln -f -s /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
```

Check that the modifications are in place.

```
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 2013-05-05 21:07 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev
```

Now we need to restart nginx so our changes take effect.

```
$ sudo service nginx restart
Restarting nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful nginx.
```

Now, when you launch the BigBlueButton client, nginx will server the client from your development directory.  Next, we need to rebuild the client.

## Building the client
Let's now build the client.  Note we're not making any changes yet to the source, we're going to first build it and run the client to make sure it works.

First, we'll build the locales (language translation files).  If you are not modifying the locales, you only need to do this once.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
ant locales
```

This will take about 10 minutes (depending on the speed of your computer).  Next, let's build the client

```
ant
```

This will create a build of the BigBlueButton client in the `/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client` directory.

**Note:** The BigBlueButton server will cache the config.xml for a given meetingID.  To ensure you load the new config.xml you must restart your BigBlueButton server after making a change to the config.xml.

The above note is important.  It's easy to make a quick change to your `config.xml` and wonder why the change is not reflected when you load the client.  You need to restart BigBlueButton using 

```
sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

After this, point your browser to your BigBlueButton server and login to the demo page.  The client should start properly.

Note: You could have also restart BigBlueButton with `sudo bbb-conf --restart`, but it's a good idea to pass `--clean` instead as it cleans out all the log files between restart and thereby wipes and previous errors.

**Note:** On the bottom of the client you'll see "VERSION", but that's OK.  This is usually replaced in the packaging by the nslatest build number.  If you see "VERSION", this is good as BigBlueButton is now loading your own copy of the client (and not the packaged version).

If you execute `sudo bbb-conf --check`, you'll notice it gives a warning

```
** Potential problems described below **
# Warning: nginx is not serving the client from /var/www/bigbluebutton/.
# Instead, it's being served from
#
#    /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
#
# (This is OK if you have setup a development environment.)
```

This is good -- it's another confirmation that the BigBlueButton server is serving your development client (not the packaged version).

## Making a change

Now that we have successfully built and loaded the client from a development environment, let's make a small visible change to the interface.  We're using `vi` to edit the client, but you can use any Unix text editor of course.

**Note:** If you are on Windows and developing using a VM, you may find it easier to setup Samba so you can access your files through Windows Explorer and use a Windows editor.  To setup Samba, type the command `bbb-conf --setup-samba`.  You can then browse the network from your Windows computer and find the shared volume.  Once mounted in windows (usually with a drive letter such as d: or e:), you can access the files directly with your editor on Windows.


```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
vi src/org/bigbluebutton/main/views/MainApplicationShell.mxml
```

Once you have `MainApplicationShell.mxml` open, go to line 680 and you'll see the following text

```mxml
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])}" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
```

Insert the text ' -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!' as shown below.

```mxml
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])} -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!!" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
```


Now, rebuild the BigBlueButton client again.

```
ant
```

When done, join the demo meeting using the client. You'll see the message `-- BigBlueButton Rocks!` added to the copyright line.

![rocks](/images/rocks.png)

If you don't see your changes, **try clearing your browser's cache and then load the client again**.  It also might be easier to just try this using Firefox since it most likely will not cache this.

## Switching back to the packaged client

To switch back to using the packaged BigBlueButton client anytime, you only need to change the symbolic link for nginx and then restart BigBlueButton (again, this reloads the `config.xml` file for the client).

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

To switch back to your development setup, simply recreate the symbolic link and restart nginx.

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

## Using Flex/Flash Builder

These steps assume that you have a local BigBlueButton development server on your network (or in a virtual machine).  The steps will have you install Samba on the server to give your Windows/Mac access to the file system to make code edits directly.  

Do not install samba on a BigBlueButton server on the internet.  Instead, if you want to use Flex/Flash Builder, first setup a local BigBlueButton server on your network (or in a virtual machine) and make the changes locally.  After you've updated the local BigBlueButton server, copy to modified files (and update any necessary configuration changes) to the remote BigBlueButton server.

To develop the client using Flash Builder on a local BigBlueButton server (we'll refer to the local server as the BigBlueButton VM, but it need not be a virtual machine you have for development), follow these steps:

  1. Install Flash Builder on your Windows/Mac machine.

  1. Setup samba on the BigBlueButton VM (use the command `sudo bbb-conf --setup-samba`) and mount the VM drive as described earlier in this document.

  1. In Flash Builder, import the project by going to File -> Import -> Flash Builder Project.

    1. Select the Project Folder radio

    1. Click Browse and choose the bigbluebutton-client directory in your BigBlueButton VM. For example W:\dev\source\bigbluebutton\bigbluebutton-client

    1. Click finish.

  1. From the BigBlueButton VM, copy the Flex SDK from ~/dev/tools into the Flash Builder SDK directory. You can see the location on the image below. Then, on Flash Builder, click Window -> Preferences -> Installed Flex SDKs and Add the SDK you have just copied. 

    ![flex-sdk](/images/flex-sdk.png)

  1. Right click on the project, go to Properties -> Flex Compiler, and change the Flex version to 4.14. (BigBlueButton does not yet work with Flex 4). Make sure the Flash Player specific version is set to at least 11.2.0. Also, check the "Flex 3 compatibility mode" option. Click Apply. 

    ![flex-compiler](/images/flex-compiler.png)

  1. Right-click on the project, click Properties -> Flex Build Path. Click on MX only component set. Make sure you add the libs directory into the path, the main source folder and the output folder. 

    ![flex-build-path](/images/flex-build-path.png)

  1. In the Flex Modules section of the properties window, add all the modules that you would like compiled with bbb-client. The modules are mxml files located in the src/ directory (default package). 

    ![flex-modules](/images/flex-modules.png)

  1. In the Package Explorer navigate to src/(default package) and _Right Click_ on BigBlueButton.mxml and click on Set As Default Application.

  1. Compile the client in Flash Builder, then open the client in your browser by going to the BigBlueButton VM's IP. The client running there should now be the client in your Flash Builder environment.

This approach is limited in the sense that you can't use the Run button within Flash Builder to launch the client. You also can't use the Flex debugger.

# Pulling localization from Transifex

1. Install the Transifex client for Ubuntu

    ```
    sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
    sudo pip install transifex-client
    ```

1. Go to the locale folder

    ```
    cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/locale 
    ```

1. Initialize the Transifex project

    ```
    tx init

    # Insert your transifex user and password
    ```
	
1. Set the BigBlueButton transifex resource

    ```
    tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton/resource/bbbresourcesproperties/
    ```

1. Edit the Transifex configuration file to filter the languages to match the BBB repository

    ```
    vi .tx/config

    file_filter = <lang>/bbbResources.properties 
    ```

1. Update all the languages from Transifex (updates only the languages existing in the current directory where the command is executed)

    ```
    tx pull -f
    ```

    Pull all the languages from Transifex (download also languages which don't exist in the local directory where the command is executed, may download undesired language directories [lt, es_429])

    ```
    tx pull -a
    ```

1. Sometimes Transifex downloads es_419 instead of es_LA (Latin American Spanish) so we need to manually update es_LA with what is in es_419

    ```
    rm -r es_LA
    cp es_419 es_LA
    ```

1. Add a gitignore to ignore the .tx folder or remove th .tx folder that is hidden

    ```
    nano .gitignore
    .tx
    ```


    or

    ```
    rm -r .tx
    ```

1. Compile to check you didn't break anything

    ```
    cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
    ant locales
    ```

# Developing BBB-Web

First, we need to update the latest bigbluebutton.properties file according to your setup. Basically, you will have to change the URL and security salt. If you don't know your salt, run `sudo bbb-conf --salt`

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/

# Edit the file and change the values of bigbluebutton.web.serverURL and securitySalt. 
vi bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/conf/bigbluebutton.properties
```

Now you need to give your user account access to upload slides to the presentation directory and also access to write log files.

```
sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/bigbluebutton
sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/log/bigbluebutton
```

Now you need to create the nginx file that will redirect calls to your development bbb-web.

```
echo "
# Handle request to bbb-web running within Tomcat. This is for
# the BBB-API and Presentation.
location /bigbluebutton {
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
	proxy_redirect default;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

	# Allow 30M uploaded presentation document.
	client_max_body_size 30m;
	client_body_buffer_size 128k;

	proxy_connect_timeout 90;

	proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;

	include fastcgi_params;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Now we just need to create a link so that the requests are redirected properly and restart nginx.

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

Now let's start grails webapp.

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web/
```

Download the necessary libraries.

```
gradle resolveDeps
```

Tell grails to listen on port 8888

```
grails -Dserver.port=8888 run-war
```

or

```
grails -reloading -Dserver.port=8888 run-app
```

If you get an error `Could not resolve placeholder 'apiVersion'`, just run `grails -Dserver.port=8888 run-war` again. The error is grails not picking up the "bigbluebutton.properties" the first time.

Now test again if you can join the demo meeting.

This will run a development version of bbb-web, but if you want to instead deploy your custom built bbb-web you need to create a war file.

```
grails war
```

This will create a file with the name bigbluebuttonv0.7dev.war. The version number for the file doesn't matter, but you should rename the war file to bigbluebutton.war. You then need to deploy the archive to tomcat. You can do this by simply copying it into the tomcat7 webapps directory.

```
sudo cp bigbluebutton.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps
```

And now just restart tomcat.

```
sudo service tomcat7 restart
```

If you changed the linking of web.nginx as instructed above you will need to also revert that back to the packaged location for bbb-web.

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
sudo service nginx restart
```


# Developing the Red5 Applications

You need to make `red5/webapps` writeable. Otherwise you will get a permission error when you try to deploy into Red5.

```
sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/red5/webapps
```

## Developing BBB-Apps

Before you build and deploy bbb-apps you need to make sure to first stop the red5 service.

```
sudo service bbb-red5 stop
```

Now you can compile and deploy bigbluebutton-apps.

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
gradle resolveDeps
gradle clean war deploy
```

And finally you can start the red5 service up again.

```
sudo service bbb-red5 start
```

## Developing BBB-Voice

First you need to stop red5.

```
sudo service bbb-red5 stop
```

Then you can compile and deploy the application.

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-voice
gradle resolveDeps
gradle war deploy
```

And finally start red5 up again.

```
sudo service bbb-red5 start
```

## Developing Deskshare

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare
gradle resolveDeps
```

### Building the applet

```
cd applet
gradle jar
```

Now we need to create a key to sign the applet. Enter a password when prompted for one. Make sure it is at least 6 chars long.

```
ant create-signing-key
```

Sign the jar file. Enter the password you created from the previous step when prompted.

```
ant sign-jar
```

If you get an error something like

```
sign-jar:
  [signjar] Signing JAR: /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar to /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar as code.signer
  [signjar] jarsigner: unable to sign jar: java.util.zip.ZipException: duplicate entry: com/myjavatools/web/ClientHttpRequest.class
  [signjar] Enter Passphrase for keystore:

BUILD FAILED
/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build.xml:70: jarsigner returned: 1

Total time: 3 seconds
```

Somehow, some classes got duplicated. Try recompiling the common directory.

```
cd ../common
gradle clean
gradle jar
```

Then sign the applet again.

The signed jar file is located in `/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar`

### Signing your own jar

  * Get a pkcs12 certificate from e.g. GoDaddy
  * got to /var/www/bigbluebutton/client
  * Make a backup of bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar
  * Sign the jar file overwriting bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar.

You need to replace your-keystore, your-password, and your-cert-alias with your values.

```
jarsigner -keystore your-keystore -storepass your-password -storetype pkcs12 -signedjar bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar bbb-deskshare-applet-unsigned-0.8.1.jar your-cert-alias
```


We need to copy it to where nginx is loading the client.

If you are developing the bbb-client also, then

```
cp /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client
```

If you are not developing the client nginx will serve the client from the default location. Therefore,

```
cp /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.8.1.jar /var/www/bigbluebutton/client/
```

### Building the server side component

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/deskshare/app
# Compile
gradle war
# Copy over to Red5
gradle deploy

# Stop red5
sudo /etc/init.d/red5 stop

cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
# Compile and deploy bbb-apps
gradle war deploy

# On another terminal window, start Red5
cd /usr/share/red5/
sudo -u red5 ./red5.sh
```

# Troubleshooting

## Connecting to the server
When the BigBlueButton client loads, it runs a number of modules: chat, voice, desktop sharing, and presentation.  Each of these modules makes a connection back to their corresponding BigBlueButton server components.

The URL for each connection is specified in [config.xml](/install/configuration-files.html#modules).

When setting up a development environment for the client, the `config.xml` file for the BigBlueButton client is now loaded from `~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/conf/config.xml`.  This means that any changes made to the default `config.xml` by `sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname>` will _not_ affect the `config.xml` in your development environment.  Thus, if you change your hostname or IP address for the BigBlueButton server, you'll need to manually change the `config.xml` for your development environment.


## Welcome to Nginx page
If you get the "Welcome to Nginx" page. Check if bigbluebutton is enabled in nginx. You should see **bigbluebutton** in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

If not, enable it.

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bigbluebutton

sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

## Old Translation
If you get a "Old Translation" warning when starting the client, in `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` change

```xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.71</localeversion>
```

to

```xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
```

## Warning: Try increasing the code cache size

If you get a compiler warning during the building of bbb-client, such as

```
build-polling:
    [mxmlc] Loading configuration file /home/dwelch/dev/tools/flex-4.5.0.20967/frameworks/flex-config.xml
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: CodeCache is full. Compiler has been disabled.
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Try increasing the code cache size using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=
    [mxmlc] /home/dwelch/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/PollingModule.swf (232039 bytes)
```

Add the following to `~/.profile`

```
export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=1024m"
```

and then reload the .profile with the command `source ~/.profile`.


## Pausing/Restarting VM gives wrong date in commit
If you are developing using a VM and you've paused the VM and later restart it, the time on the VM will be incorrect. The incorrect time will affect any commits you do in GitHub.

To ensure your VM has the correct time, you can install ntp with

```
sudo apt-get install ntp
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

and then do the following after starting the VM from a paused state

```
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

The above will re-sync your clock.


# Developing Using Eclipse
These instructions assume that you are developing with a VM running on a Windows machine.

## Set-up Samba

```
bbb-conf --setup-samba 
```

Now map the VM as a network drive.

For each project, you need to generate Eclipse project files. So, in bbb-app, you run the following to generate the project file.

```
gradle eclipse
```

Then you can import the project into Eclipse by clicking on File->New-> Java Project. Uncheck "Use default location" and browse to the project you want to import.
